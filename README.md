# Crop_Prediction_using_ML

1. Crop Prediction using Machine Learning Model
2. Agriculture is one of the major revenue producing sectors of India.
3. Numerous factors influence the crop production such as seasonal, economic and biological patterns.
4. Due to global warming the climatic conditions are not predictable and lead to a great loss to this sector, especially farmers.
5. These risks can be reduced when a suitable model that can predict the crop type to plant based on data related to soil type, temperature, humidity and rainfall. This will lead to maximize profit.

# Conclusion:

1. We can have an accurate crop prediction model by using the Random Forest algorithm.
2. This model helps agricultural sector, especially the farmers to take the right decision for right crop and there by maximize profits.
